## Dockerized Deployment
Octaview leverages Docker for containerization, ensuring consistent and reliable deployments across different environments. Each component of the platform is packaged into its own Docker container, making it easy to deploy and scale.

## Multi-Cloud Architecture
Octaview's architecture utilizes a multi-cloud approach, taking advantage of the strengths of different cloud providers:

#### AWS: Used for hosting the Yjs signaling server (EC2) and storing static assets (S3).
#### GCP: Used for running the Judge0 code execution environment (Compute Engine).
#### Vercel: Used for deploying and scaling the frontend application.

## This multi-cloud strategy provides benefits such as:

Increased resilience: If one cloud provider experiences an outage, the other parts of the system can still function.
Cost optimization: By selecting the most cost-effective services from different providers, Octaview can optimize its infrastructure costs.
Improved performance: By distributing workloads across different regions and providers, Octaview can improve application performance and reduce latency.
